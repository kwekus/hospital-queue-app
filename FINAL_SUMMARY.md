## 💬 How GitHub + Vercel Works

```
Your Computer → GitHub → Vercel → Internet
   (Code)    (Storage)  (Deploy)  (Live)
     ↓           ↓         ↓        ↓
   local     cloud repo  build   production
    dev      version    & host   server
             control    (24/7)
```

**Simple:** Every time you push to GitHub, Vercel automatically:
1. Builds your app
2. Tests it
3. Deploys to servers
4. Updates your live link

**No manual action needed after initial setup!**
